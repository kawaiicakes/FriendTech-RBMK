HBM's NTM RBMK management program written for the Minecraft FriendTech SMP. Intended to be ran on OpenComputers. 

NB: This program assumes you're able to connect a cable to the RBMK Console (from the middle block on the bottom side). FriendTech uses an older version of HBM's, and I'm not sure the newer versions retain this compat. 

To anyone who has accidentally stumbled across this, you are free to use this code as you wish, so long as you provide a copy of the license and give credit towards me.
